<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>
  I've watched this series multiple times over and over again and it never gets
  old.
</p>
<h3>Squid Game</h3>
<p>Not really a movie but I thought this was a pretty nice show.</p>
<h3>Conjuring</h3>
<p>
  I like all horror movies in general but I couldn't think of one in particular
